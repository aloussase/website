                    Hi! I'm Alexander Goussas. I'm a CS undergrad student at ESPOL,
                    Ecuador. I am also an active member of the university's
                    Open Source club #
                    <a href=https://github.com/kokoaespol>Kokoa.
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about many programming topics and love having
                    fun programming with friends, though I don't have many friends
                    that like programming ðŸ˜‚.
                <p>
                    I'm also a sucker for fantasy books, specially the Cosmere.
                    I like practicing martial arts in my free time. A fun fact
                    is that I've been trying to learn french because I am ashamed
                    of having "Goussas" as my last name and not knowing it.
