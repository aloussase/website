# Welcome!

As you probably read in the About section, currently I'm a CS student in
Guayaquil, Ecuador. I am very passionate about programming, but also about
things such as "The Cosmere" and martial arts.

This is the first step in my blogging journey. I plan on writing about many
different topics, not just programming. I can't promise I will write at regular
intervals, but anytime something naturally comes to me. I think that will be
best to keep the posts real and not just write for the sake of writing.

Thank you for reading, and (hopefully) see you in the next one!
